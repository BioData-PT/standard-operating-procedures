## 4. Purpose
This document outlines the roles, responsibilities, and tasks for individuals involved in the writing, implementation, management, and use of GDI SOP resources. It contributes to the framework, defined in the [Charter](./GDI-SOP_charter.md), for SOP development, review, approval, authorisation, maintenance and training within the GDI network.

## 5. Scope
The roles and responsibilities described in this document apply to:
- **GDI SOP Management**: all persons and organisations authorised to develop and decide on the GDI SOP roles and responsibilities as described in this procedure. These include, but are not limited to: drafting, authoring, reviewing, approving, authorising and maintaining SOPs.
- **GDI Node Service Operators**: Personnel involved in testing, implementing, and operating GDI services according to the SOPs.
- **GDI Governance Bodies**: Committees like the Operations Committee (OC) and Security and Data Protection Committee (SDPC) responsible for overseeing the SOP lifecycle.
